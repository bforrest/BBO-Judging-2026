## 🎯 CURRENT SCHEDULE STATUS

### Overall Health: ⚠️ MANAGEABLE (23/44 tables good)

| Category | Count | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Running Smoothly | 23 | ✅ |
| Critical Issues | 2 | 🚨 |
| Overworked | 1 | ⚠️ |
| Entry Conflicts | 13 | 🔄 |
| Pairing Issues | 5 | 📊 |

## 🚨 TOP PRIORITY ISSUES

### CRITICAL - Act Immediately
1. **T88 Dallas Specialty Beer** (02/28 AM)
   - 36 entries, only 1 certified judge
   - ACTION: Add 2 certified judges

2. **T93 Grapevine Specialty Cider** (02/28 AM)
   - 36 entries, only 1 certified judge
   - ACTION: Add 2 certified judges

### HIGH PRIORITY - This Week
- **Brian Street** has conflicts at 9+ tables → Reassign immediately
- **13 other judges** have entry conflicts → Need reassignment

### MEDIUM PRIORITY - Next
- **5 tables** have pairing imbalances → Add more certified judges

## 🔍 KEY FINDINGS

### What's Working Well ✅
- 23 tables (52%) have good judge assignments
- Most tables have acceptable workload (9-12 beers/pair)
- Balance of certified/non-certified judges on most tables

### What Needs Fixing ❌
- 2 critical tables with 36 beers and 1 judge each
- 13 tables with judges evaluating their own entries
- 5 tables with insufficient certified judges
- 1 table with excessive workload (15 beers/pair)

---

## 📊 JUDGE PAIRING ANALYSIS

### Current Judge Distribution
- **Total judges:** ~100+ across all sites
- **Total certified judges:** ~50-60
- **Average per table:** 4-5 judges (2-3 certified)

### Optimization Opportunity
- With better pairing: Could reduce workload on critical tables
- With better conflict resolution: Could improve fairness
- With rebalancing: Could improve judge experience

## 🎓 OPTIMIZATION CONCEPTS

### The Three Rules
1. **Pairing Rule:** Non-certified judges must pair with certified judges
2. **Workload Rule:** Ideal 9 beers/pair, max 12, critical if >15
3. **Conflict Rule:** Judge cannot evaluate their own entry

### Judge Ranking System
- **Rank 0:** Non-BJCP → Cannot lead pair
- **Rank 1:** Provisional → Cannot lead pair
- **Rank 2:** Rank Pending/Recognized → Cannot lead pair
- **Rank 3:** Certified → Can lead pair ✅
- **Rank 4:** National → Can lead pair ✅

### Success Metrics
- No table with only 1 certified judge
- Average workload 9-12 beers per pair
- Zero entry conflicts
- Balanced ratio of certified to non-certified
